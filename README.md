# Challenge-1

## Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to refactor some code of an exisitng website of a marketing agency to make it more accessible. Web accessibility can cover a wide spectrum. In this particular situation, the goal was to make the website more optimized for search engines. To do this, I was tasked to ensure the HTML elements were semantic and followed a logical structure that was independent of styling and positioning. Accessible alt attributes were added to the image elements (meaning a quick caption was added when hovering over the image to give the user a worded description of the image). All headings were re-organized in a sequential order. And lastly, the title was made concise and descriptive.

## Results
The results of the analysis determined that:
- There are 90,398 employees with impending retirement out of the 300,024 total amount of unique employees at Pewlett Hackard. This encompasses around 30.1% of the total amount of employees. Below shows the query codes for both those who are retiring and the total amount of employees.

- The job title with the highest number of employees with forthcoming retirement is "Senior Engineer". There are 29,414 Senior Engineers eligible for retirement. This covers around 32.5% of titles of those who are retiring soon. Senior Staff represent around 31.3% of those retiring, those with the title "Engineer" represent around 15.7%, 13.5% are Staff, Technique Leaders comprise about 5%, and Managers are very miniscule.

- There are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program. This number represents the number of *mentorees* who will be mentored by the 90,398 retiring employees, the mentors.
- This would mean that there is around a 58:1 ratio of mentors to mentorees.
