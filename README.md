# Challenge-1

## Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to refactor some code of an exisitng website of a marketing agency to make it more accessible. Web accessibility can cover a wide spectrum. In this particular situation, the goal was to make the website more optimized for search engines. To do this, I was tasked to ensure the HTML elements were semantic and followed a logical structure that was independent of styling and positioning. Accessible alt attributes were added to the image elements (meaning a quick caption was added when hovering over the image to give the user a worded description of the image). All headings were re-organized in a sequential order. And lastly, the title was made concise and descriptive. CSS selectors were also consolidated and a description of each line of CSS code was added for clarity of what each code is intended to alter visually. The link to the newly revamped website is [here](https://fgrodasmendez1.github.io/Challenge-1/).
